# Zmojiboard
Zmojiboard aims to be a lightweight, effiecient means of finding emoji natively on desktop.

Currently the program only supports a CLI interface written in java but in the future I hope it becomes graphical (possibly based on electron).
## //TODO

## Usage

java -jar Zmojiboard.jar search *language* *query*`

e.g.
